# IfcWebExplorer overview

Based on Python 3, Flask and JavaScript, IfcWebExplorer is a cross-platform IFC data viewer to look up the IFC attributes and relationships. IFC schema files are parsed using IfcOpenShell (http://www.ifcopenshell.org/). 

If you are not familiar with python, you can download the IFCWEBEXPLORER.zip file and unzip it. There will be a “static” folder and a “server.exe” file. Then, double click the “server.exe” file and allow your computer to run this program. The details about how to use IfcWebExplorer are included in the manual file (how_to_use_IfcWebExplorer.pdf).

If you are familiar with python, you can download the source files in. The start file is “server.py”.
